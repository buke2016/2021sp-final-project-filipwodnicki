"Transit + OSMnx"  
by Filip Wodnicki

*Final project submission for:*

Harvard Extension School  
Advanced Python for Data Science (CSCI E-29)   
Spring 2021

Domain: transportation, public transit, urban planning, networks, graphs

### Bottom line: Networks and multimodal routing!

3. Parsing ipynb notebooks (using myst-nb library)  
4. Google docstring style via Sphinx Napoleon  

# Transit + OSMnx

## Objective
Build a multi-modal walking and transit network, with Python, open source libraries, and open data.

## Getting started

### Basic usage
```shell
make data
```

```python
from final_project import WalkNetwork, TransitNetwork, MultiNetwork

# Make a MultiNetwork
W = WalkNetwork.create_from_name("Boston")
T = TransitNetwork.create_from_gtfs("data/MBTA_GTFS.zip")  # Uses the GTFS from Makefile
WT = MultiNetwork.combine(walk=W, transit=T)

# Map it
m = WT.mapper
m

# Route on it!
BOS_airport = (42.36924490636996, -71.02041230759893)
harvard_DCE = (42.375019663272305, -71.12022229636055)

shortest_route, shortest_dist = WT.get_shortest_pair(origin=BOS_airport, dest=harvard_DCE)
```

### Installation
```
conda install -r requirements.txt
git clone https://github.com/csci-e-29/2021sp-final-project-filipwodnicki.git
```

## Background
The python library [osmnx](https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx) introduced the ability to easily download [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) (OSM) data and build a queryable [networkx](https://networkx.org/) graph of a) road, b) walking, and c) bike path networks for analysis. However, OSM is a limited and incomplete source of data on actual public transport services. In contrast, libraries like [peartree](https://github.com/kuanb/peartree) and pandana create spatio-temporal models of public transport systems based on [GTFS](https://gtfs.org/) schedule data. However, these libraries donâ€™t integrate those public transport models back into the surrounding walking and biking networks, leaving them out of context of the greater urban fabric.

## Approach
1. Explore.  
2. Solve.  
3. Refactor.  

## Deliverables

### Library
See the [Code Reference](./reference.md) and [repo](https://github.com/filipwodnicki/2021sp-final-project-filipwodnicki)

### Demo
See [Demo.ipynb](./Demo.ipynb) where we walk through combining the walking and transit networks of New Orleans.

## Architecture
![architecture diagram](./img/architecture.png)

## Advanced Python
Please see the writeup on concepts used here: [Discussion - Advanced Python Concepts](./adv_py.md).

## Conclusion
The main contribution of this project is a toolkit for solving a real-world problem routing
in new ways. The mission of building a Multi-modal Transit+Walking graph was achieved! 
An R&D process (Explore, Solve, Refactor) came out of this project.

## Acknowledgements

Thank you Prof Gorlin and teaching staff. I dreamed of doing projects like this for fun.
And now, I can(!!)

## Future
But it's not the end! Here are some ideas for next steps:
* Address WIP: namely testing
* Contribute to osmnx or Peartree
* Scale Pandas operations via Dask - How could be build and store a MultiNetwork for the whole world!?
* Build out visualization - e.g. time isochrone of places accessible within 15 minutes
* Expose routing as API via Django
* And more...
